<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
### About The Project

The project mainly consist of two componenets : 
- **A Graph Editor**: 
  - To draw nodes and edges of a graph either by drawing on a canvas or by entering the graph info in a matrix or a text format.
   

- **Algorithm visualizer**:  
  - Which simply visualize how multiple graph algorithms work and allow interction with them.
---
###**_Note_**:
**_This project was built from scratch without the usage of any external libraries as a 
challenge and opportunity to enhance our skills and to gain some new experience._**

---

### Features

### need to be updated (TODO)

 - It contains full dynamic area which supports : 
   - adding and deleting nodes.
   - adding directed and indirected edges between nodes, also putting weights on the edges.
   - saving your drawed graph.
   - drag and drop the nodes.
 - Drawing the graph inside the area using adjacency matrix.
 - Running and visualzing different Algorithms like (DrawAsTree, finding minimum distance between two nodes,etc).

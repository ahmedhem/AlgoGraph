<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
### About The Project

The project mainly consist of two componenets : 
- **A Graph Editor**: 
  - To draw nodes and edges of a graph either by drawing on a canvas or by entering the graph info in a matrix or a text format.
   

- **Algorithm visualizer**:  
  - Which simply visualize how multiple graph algorithms work and allow interction with them.

### **_Note_**:
**_This project was built from scratch without the usage of any external libraries as a 
challenge and opportunity to enhance our skills and to gain some new experience._**

## AlgoGraph

### [Live Demo](https://ahmedhem.github.io/AlgoGraph/)

AlgoGraph is a tool to draw graphs and  visualizing different graph's algorithms.
<br>
### Features: 
 - It contains full dynamic area which supports : 
   - adding and deleting nodes.
   - adding directed and indirected edges between nodes, also putting weights on the edges.
   - saving your drawed graph.
   - drag and drop the nodes.
 - Drawing the graph inside the area using adjacency matrix.
 - Running and visualzing different Algorithms like (DrawAsTree, finding minimum distance between two nodes,etc).

## AM
- adding undo to almost all animations
- handling the final state of every animation
- try to visualize one algorithm

--- bugs founded : 
- when we add another weight to an edge, duplicates weights not allowed because of SET
  Solution: use multiset;

- any weight has drawn on the canvas will be disappered after calling UI.fire();
  Solution : firstly all the logic of the fix will be seperated from Canvas function.

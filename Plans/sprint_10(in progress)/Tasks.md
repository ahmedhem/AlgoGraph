- asking the user to choose a root for the tree (Algorithms: Draw-as-tree.js)
- Visualizer >> node and edges methods

### Done
- Graph.deep_copy()  
- Change, undo, redo
- close the textarea issue

Change:
- type >> node change or edge change
- animation >> the type of the animation >> is it a swap a size change or... 
to be able to choose the right function to call
- old_state, and new_state >> objects that have different content based 
on the type and the animation 
(what have change in the animation and the info needed to reverse it )

## Eid
- Matrix input
- (u v cost) repreasentaion of a graph


## Magdy  (Done)
### Grid
- Calculatedepth() (d)
- handleNodeSize()
- for each level calcluate number of nodes in that level then justify-content-around

#### Un solved bugs :
    - some graphs can't be compeletly drawn because of the nodes in each row are more than the availble cells
    - the program can  do bfs for only one components not many
    - bfs start from node 1 so if the user's input doesn't have node 1 it won't work 
    - the bfs act strange when we create an edge from node 2 to 1 (not from 1 to 2)

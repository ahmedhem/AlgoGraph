#### Un solved bugs :
    - some graphs can't be compeletly drawn because of the nodes in each row are more than the availble cells
    - the program can  do bfs for only one components not many
    - bfs start from node 1 so if the user's input doesn't have node 1 it won't work 
    - the bfs act strange when we create an edge from node 2 to 1 (not from 1 to 2)
-----
- drag need to be only from the header
- the nodeSize range need to be fixed
- node count need to be fixed

## add a header to the site
- be creative
### Convert toolbox to sidebar
### feature / tooltip
### Update readme
### choose a font for the site
### BfS algo

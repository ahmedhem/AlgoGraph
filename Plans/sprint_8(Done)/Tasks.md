## AE
- (Done) refactoring the pop style and code:
    - the style:
        - need to be consistent
    - the code:
        -   abstract the modal logic from the pop up content

`

        - let content = `entr a root for the tree`;

            let popup = popup_content(content);
            popup.open();
            popup.close();
            popup.changeSize();


`
-  (done) add tooltip icon

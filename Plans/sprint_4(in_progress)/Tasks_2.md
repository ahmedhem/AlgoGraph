### Eid :
- Storage refactoring 
    1. implement (done)
    2. modify the drawUI method to work with it

    
- Algorithms class structure (to be discussed)
- ##### Note (AE):
    - will not be useful in our case
        - since each algorithm could just be added as a method on the Graph class
            - when we choose an algorithm we could just call its method 
                - so there is not need for the overhead and complexity of this way
  

- Draggable Node (optional)  
### Magdy :
    - GUI :
        - weight for every edge + delete button 
    - Adjancey Matrix Frontend

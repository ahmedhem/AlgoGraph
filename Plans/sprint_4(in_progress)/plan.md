### multiple graphs

- instead of multiple edges
    - write all weight on the edge
    - multiple weights edge has different color
    - when clicked a pop up appear with a list of the weight (and any other information)
- **Draggable Nodes**
    - can drag a node for a different place after clicking it for time

#  draw a graph from the backend :

- BFS : (Magdy)

### Graph input >>> Adjacency Matrix

- as a user when i click a button i am prompted for the number of Vertices and weighted or unweighted
    - when I give the input :
        - a table (i.e. matrix) for filling the matrix
            - every cell :
                - is edges from (row >> column)
                    - when i give number > 0 :
                        - i am prompted for the weight for every edge
                    - if the number of edges < 0:
                        - throw error
